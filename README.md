# ACSL Submissions, 2020-2021
This is my code for ACSL problems that I've done for competitions.

## NOTES
This code can be used for any purpose whatsoever. That being said, it isn't done very well and can be rather unintuitive. The code itself will be in Python or Java, and I
haven't made any edits to it after submitting. Some may also have internal comments, which were just used for organization.
